# Generative_AI_ChatBot

As the final weeks of my Data Science Bootcamp come to a close, I find myself playing with Generative AI and dreaming of the possibilities. One idea that comes to mind is asking my LLM model to act like a financial expert and suggest stocks to invest in. Perhaps Solana? 😜

On the other hand, a career counselling chatbot would be incredibly helpful at this stage 😓 . I could ask, "How can I get a data scientist job in Germany?" Exciting times ahead! 😄
